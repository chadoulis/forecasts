Among friends, colleagues or peers a disagreement may occur. And it may take a long time
before it is made clear which of the arguing parts was right and which was wrong. Using this app
you can keep track of the issues that have been an object of disagreement. And when the truth shines, 
you can either acknowledge the other part or get acknowledged for the validity of your initial claim.
